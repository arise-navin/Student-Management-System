2. Abstract    
Fog Computing is an emerging paradigm that extends Cloud Computing to the edge of the network, enabling faster data processing, reduced latency, and improved efficiency for IoT applications. This project explores the architecture, benefits, and implementation challenges of Fog Computing. The proposed system will demonstrate how Fog Computing can optimize real-time data analytics, enhance security, and reduce bandwidth consumption in IoT ecosystems.  

Key technologies used include   edge devices (Raspberry Pi, sensors), lightweight communication protocols (MQTT, CoAP), and microservices architecture  . The project will also evaluate performance metrics such as latency, scalability, and energy efficiency.  

 



3. Introduction    
3.1 Background    
With the exponential growth of IoT devices, traditional cloud computing faces challenges like   high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, and security risks  . Fog Computing addresses these issues by   bringing computation closer to data sources  , enabling real-time processing.  

      3.2 Problem Statement    
-   Latency Issues:   Cloud-based IoT systems suffer from delays in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, autonomous vehicles).  
-   Bandwidth Overload:   Transmitting massive IoT data to the cloud consumes excessive bandwidth.  
-   Security Risks:   Centralized cloud storage increases vulnerability to cyberattacks.  

      3.3 Objectives    
- Develop a   Fog Computing model   to reduce latency.  
- Optimize   bandwidth usage   by local data processing.  
- Implement   security measures   for edge devices.  
- Evaluate performance against traditional cloud systems.
